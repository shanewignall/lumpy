Different measures can help you better understand the data you are working with. Some measures can help you find the typical value in a set, such as the mean, median, or mode. Other measures give you an idea of the range and spread of the data. Quartiles , on the other hand, divide an ordered set of data into four approximately equal parts, helping you tell where values are positioned in relation to other values within the data set. Calculate the mean, the median, and the mode to find the typical values, or measures of central tendency, of a set of data. The values in a data set will vary. Explore different ways to determine how much variation the data set has. Quartiles help you determine where a value falls in relation to the median of a set of data. Measures of central tendency are the typical values of a set of data. You have probably worked with these measures before. They are the mean, median, and mode. The mean , the true mathematical average of the data set, is the measure of central tendency that is most often reported. The mode is the simplest measure of central tendency . The mode is the value of the observation that occurs most often. To find the mode, the data is placed in order from smallest to largest, and the observation with the highest frequency is identified. Example: Given the following data set, the mode would be identified as the value that occurs most often, which is 5. 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 10 The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can have two values. Distributions that have two modes are said to be bi-modal distributions. Just as the median runs in the middle of two roads, the median is the middle number in a distribution. To find the median, we simply find the middle number of the distribution. That's simple to do when we have an odd number of observations in our data set: there will be only one middle number and we just count in to find it. Example: Given the following dataset, the median is 7. Since there are 13 total observations, the median, or middle number, would be the seventh one, since that would leave 6 numbers to the left side of that number and 6 numbers to the right. 3 4 5 5 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 10 11 If we have an even number of observations in our data set, however, we have to calculate the median using the two middle numbers. In other words, we locate the two middle numbers, add them together, and divide by two. Example: Given the following dataset, the median is 7.50. Since there are 14 total observations, we have two middle numbers: 7 and 8. To calculate the median, we sum 7 and 8 (which equals 15), and divide that sum by 2 (15/2 = 7.5). 3 4 5 5 5 6 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 This illustration displays two examples of data sets with median indicated. Example 1 is the data set 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, with number 7 highlighted in the middle. Example 2 is the data set 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, with numbers 7 and 8 highlighted in the middle. To determine the median, you must use the two middle numbers 7 and 8. 7 plus 8 equals 15. 15 divided by 2 is 7.5. The median is 7.5. The mean is the true mathematical average of the data set. To calculate the mean, we sum together all of the observations, and then divide the sum by the total number of observations. Example: Given the following data set, the mean is 6.4. To calculate the mean, we first sum all of the observations (3+4+5+6+6+6+7+8+9+10=64) and then divide that sum by the total number of observations (64/10=6.4). 3 4 5 6 6 6 7 8 9 10 The mean is the measure of central tendency most often reported, however, it is also the one most influenced by outliers, that is, observations that are extremely high or extremely low as compared to the other observations in our distribution. For example, an extremely large value will result in a mean that is higher than the rest of the data would suggest. An extremely low value will result in a mean that is lower than the data might suggest. Thus, whenever outliers are present, it is more appropriate to report the median instead of the mean. The mode is 7, as it occurs the most times in the set. The median is 7, as it is the middle number within the set. The mean, or average, is 6. (2 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 = 66; 66 ÷ 11 = 6.) This topic supported these objectives: It is often important to use different types of measurement to interpret data. Finding the measure of central tendency gives you an idea of a typical value in the data set. The mean is the average of the data and is probably the most commonly used measure of central tendency. To find the mean, add the values and divide the sum by the number of values in the data set. The mean is affected by any extreme values more than the median or mode. The median is the actual middle value of a set of data. If you order the values from least to greatest, the median is the middle value. If the data set has an even number of values, you need to perform an extra step. To find the median, you must determine the sum of the two middle values and divide by two. The mode of a set of data is the value that occurs most often. There can be more than one mode in a set of data or no mode at all. Measures of variability can be used to give you an idea of how much the data vary. The range gives you a quick idea of how large a spread the data have. The standard deviation tells you if the data are vastly different from the mean. The range is the simplest measure of variability. We calculate the range by subtracting the smallest observation from the largest observation. For example, given the following data, the range would equal 15-5 = 10. 5 6 6 7 8 9 9 9 11 15 15 The range is a very simple measure of variability, but it quickly tells us how large of a spread the data have. A large range indicates that the data are spread out; a smaller range indicates that the data are clustered around the mean. Illustration of male basketball team members in a line from shortest to longest and captions showing inches and range. The dataset of heights of the basketball players is 72, 73, 76, 76, 78, 67, 72, 76, 76, 84. To calculate the range, take the smallest number in the set 72 and subtract it from the largest number 84. 84 minus 72 equals 12. The range of this data set is 12. Variance measures the deviation of a population or sample data set from its mean. The variance is the mean of the squared deviations. In other words, the difference between each observation in our data set and the mean is calculated and then squared. Those squared values are summed, and the sum is divided by n - 1. The resulting figure is the variance, which is abbreviated . Example: It is usually easier to calculate the variance if we put our data in a table. The first step is to calculate the mean, as we need that in order to calculate the variance. With this data set, the mean is 8.667 (reminder: we sum the scores, 5+6+8+10+11+12 = 52, then divide by the number of scores (6). Thus, the mean is 52/6 = 8.667). Now that we have our mean, we subtract the mean from each observation to find the difference (see table, middle column). Next, we square the differences for column 3 of the table. A table showing how to calculate variance for 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12. This table has three columns, the first for x, the second for the calculation of deviation from mean, and the third for the square of the deviation. For x equals 5, the deviation from the mean is calculated as 5 minus 8.667 equals negative 3.667. The square of the deviation is calculated as negative 3.667 squared equals 13.447. For x equals 6, the deviation from the mean is calculated as 6 minus 8.667 equals negative 2.667. The square of the deviation is calculated as negative 2.667 squared equals 7.113. For x equals 8, the deviation from the mean is calculated as 8 minus 8.667 equals negative .667. The square of the deviation is calculated as negative .667 squared equals .445. For x equals 10, the deviation from the mean is calculated as 10 minus 8.667 equals 1.333. The square of the deviation is calculated as 1.333 squared equals 1.777. For x equals 11, the deviation from the mean is calculated as 11 minus 8.667 equals 2.333. The square of the deviation is calculated as 2.333 squared equals 5.443. For x equals 12, the deviation from the mean is calculated as 12 minus 8.667 equals 3.333. The square of the deviation is calculated as 3.333 squared equals 11.109. While it's true that the variance is a measure of variability, it's not a very useful one. Because we are using squared deviations to calculate the variance, the variance is in squared units. It doesn't really give us an accurate measure of variability. But, we have to use squared units. Otherwise, the sum of the mean deviations in column 2 would equal 0!! That isn't helpful! (Test it yourself: -3.667 + -2.667 + -.667 + 1.333 + 2.333 + 3.333 = .002, which is essentially 0. Note: This may not equal 0 exactly because we have rounded our values at each step of the problem, thus, we have rounding error in our figures.) In fact, the mean deviation for any data set is zero. Therefore, variance provides a positive value to measure the overall variation in the data set. The variance is reported in squared units and we can't use it as an accurate measure of variability, so why do we calculate it? We calculate the variance so that we can use it to find our standard deviation . The standard deviation of a distribution is a rough measure of the average amount by which observations deviate from the mean. In other words, smaller standard deviations indicate that the data are not very different from the mean and larger standard deviations indicate that the data are spread out from the mean. Standard deviation is abbreviated s, and is calculated by taking the square root of the variance.You'll see that the formula is exactly the same as the formula for variance, except that we take the square root of what we calculate. Thus, to find the standard deviation, first calculate the variance and then take the square root. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE STEPS AGAIN!! Just take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation! Measures of variability give you a better understanding of the values in a data set. The range is calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the greatest value. A large range indicates that the data are spread out. A smaller range indicates that the data are clustered closer around the mean. The standard deviation measures the average amount by which values differ from the mean. As with range, a larger deviation indicates that the data are spread out from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data are not much different from the mean. Quartiles allow you to quickly analyze data. As the name implies, quartiles divide an ordered data set into four approximately equal parts. You can use quartiles to quickly determine where about 25% of the values fall at or below, where about 50% of the values fall at or below, and where about 75% of the values fall at or below. Quartiles divide the ordered observations into four approximately equal parts. About one-fourth or 25% of the data fall at or below the first quartile ; about one half or 50% of the data fall at or below the second quartile ; and about three-quarters or 75% of the data fall at or below the third quartile . The second quartile is equal to the median of the distribution. To locate the first, second, and third quartiles, we first have to order our list of observations, or our distribution. Once the data is in order, we need to find the median of the distribution (remember: the median is the middle number in the case of an odd number of observations OR the mean of the two middle numbers in the case of an even number of observations). The median of the distribution is the second quartile. Once we have identified the second quartile, we can divide our data set into the lower half of scores and the upper half of scores. Once we have two halves, we find the median for each half in the same way we find the median for the overall distribution. The median for the lower half of the observations is the first quartile; the median for the upper half of the observations is the third quartile. For example, if we take the data set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} the graph to the right shows you where the 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd quartiles fall within that data. As you can see the median is 6, the 1 st quartile is equivalent to the mean of 2 and 4 which is 3, and the 3 rd quartile is equivalent to the mean of 8 and 10 which is 9. Diagram showing the dataset 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 plotted on a number line with a box plot showing the quartiles. On the number line, there are blue dots for each data point at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The 1st quartile is marked at 3. The median is marked at 6. The 3rd quartile is marked at 9. Given the following data set, let's find the first, second, and third quartiles. First Quartile: The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the distribution. The lower half of our distribution is 5 5 6 6 7, and the median of these observations is 6. Thus, the first quartile equals 6. Second Quartile: The second quartile is equal to the median of the distribution. In this case, the median is the middle number, or 8. Thus, the second quartile is 8. The second quartile divides our distribution in half, and we use each half to find our first and third quartiles. Third Quartile: The third quartile is the median of the upper half of the distribution. The upper half of our distribution is 9 10 11 12 13, and the median of these observations is 11. Thus, the third quartile equals 11. So, what do these quartile values tell us? We can look at our quartiles and quickly determine that about 25% of our observations fall at or below 6, about 50% of our observations fall at or below 8, and about 75% of our observations fall at or below 11. Further, we can use our quartiles to calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) . To calculate the IQR, we subtract the first quartile from the third quartile. With this distribution, our IQR would be 11-6 = 5. The IQR is an indication of how much the middle 50% of our distribution varies. Quartiles divide an ordered data set into four approximately equal parts. The second quartile is equal to the median of the data set, so half the values fall at or below the second quartile and half fall at or above it. To find the first quartile, find the median of the lower half of the data. To find the third quartile, find the median of the upper half of the data. About one-fourth, or 25%, of the data fall at or below the first quartile. About one-half, or 50%, of the data fall at or below the second quartile. And about three-quarters, or 75%, of the data fall at or below the third quartile. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third and first quartiles. Finding measures of central tendency gives you an idea of the typical value in a set of data. The measures of variability indicate the amount of variation within the data, and the measures of position break the data in four equal parts. By using these measures, you will have a better understanding of the values and range of the data. You also have a better understanding of how accurate a representation the mean and median are of the entire set of data. Statistics are organized data that provide information. The uses for statistics are endless. Perhaps, a survey found that four out of five doctors recommend getting a second opinion before having surgery. Is it likely that all doctors were surveyed? No, it's more reasonable that a smaller group of doctors gave their recommendation. Then researchers applied the results to the larger doctor population. Accuracy is important when working with data and statistics. A common mathematical error could change the data and result in incorrect conclusions. Statistics keep us informed and are used to make educated choices. Statistics can tell what percentage of people voted or the success rate of a specific cancer treatment. Reviewing common problem areas can help you avoid mistakes in your work with statistics. Data are gathered from either the entire group being studied or from a representative sampling of that group. Statistics tell what was learned from the data. Data that are gathered may have a numeric value or may be part of a category, such as gender or marital status. Take five minutes to glance through stories on the Internet or in a newspaper. Notice all the references to statistics. Statistics provide information you analyze and interpret to help keep people informed. We are exposed to statistics on a daily basis, in newspapers, magazines, on television and radio news and talk shows. The use of statistics is all around us! "Eating less and getting regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer by 35%." "Seventy-five percent of middle school girls indicate that math is their least favorite subject, and 49% of those who don't like math indicate that it is the subject in which they are performing most poorly." "The company's profits increased by 4.9% in 2008; 2009 showed an increase in profits of 1.8% over 2008; and 2010 seems to be holding at the same level as 2009." "Of the 1000 people surveyed, 390 (39%) supported the lowering of the speed limit in the downtown area, while 480 (48%) were against it; 130 (13%) of those surveyed indicated that they didn't have strong feelings either way." So, what is statistics anyway? Statistics is the use of data to make informed decisions. The data are collected and organized, analyzed using an appropriate set of statistical tests, and interpreted within the context of our research questions. Statistics have been around for about 2,000 years! Early civilizations collected data in matters that concerned the state: births, deaths, taxes, etc. The Latin derivation of statistics is status , which means state . While we still use statistics for matters of state, we also use statistics in business, education, psychology, economics, and a host of other areas. This pie chart illustrates the opinion of people regarding speed limits. The Green colored section shows 48 percent people indifferent to speed limits; blue colored section shows 39 percent people for lowering speed limit; and 13 percent people against lowering speed limit is show in orange. Data are collected, organized, analyzed, and interpreted. Statistics is the use of data to make informed decisions. Statistics are used to support decisions in areas such as business, politics, and sports. You may even make personal decisions based on statistical information, such as which school has a better success rate for placing graduates in the workforce. Mathematical errors can have a domino effect in statistics—a small error may have a large impact. Forgetting the order of operations can cause you to miscalculate and compromise your data. A brief review of the most common problem areas can help you in your work with statistics. Some mistakes made in studying statistics can be traced back to a minor mathematical error. The most common errors occur with order of operations, fractions and rounding. Therefore, it is helpful to begin with a brief review of some these mathematical concepts. " Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater." Albert Einstein US ( German-born) physicist (1879-1955) A mathematical expression used throughout statistics is the fraction. When someone says "Thirty-seven percent of the population agrees with raising taxes," they simply mean the fraction of the population that agrees with raising taxes is a fraction equal to .37 when converted into a decimal. A fraction is another way of symbolizing division. A fraction means "divide the first (top) expression (the numerator) by the second (bottom) expression (the denominator)." One very important rule to remember regarding fractions is that you can never divide by zero. Although zero divided by any number is always zero, the opposite is not true; a number divided by zero is undefined. To multiply fractions you should multiply their numerators together and multiply their denominators together. Keep in mind, if you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number it does not change the value of the fraction. To divide by a fraction, invert and multiply. That is, take the fraction you're dividing by (the divisor), switch the denominator and numerator, and the multiply it by the fraction you are dividing into (the dividend). To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator; that is, their denominators must be the same. For example, you can't add 2/3 and 1/5 as they are, you have to change them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator. How? By multiplying the denominators (and of course, the numerators) by some number that will make the denominators equal. And, of course, you don't have to use the same number for each fraction. Some fractions, when divided out, produce decimals that go on and on. To get rid of unneeded decimal places, we can round the number. Say you have the number 1.41421 and you want to express it with just two decimal places. Should your answer be 1.41 or 1.42? To answer this question, you must look at the first digit beyond the last decimal place you wish to keep. In this example, we want to keep two decimal places. If the third decimal place is less than 5, then the number in the second decimal place stays as is; if it is 5 or larger, then the value of the second decimal place increases by 1. Order of operations is very important when calculating expressions with several different types of operations. If the proper order of operations is not followed, incorrect answers will be obtained. To help you remember the order of operations you should remember this expression: P lease E xcuse M y D ear A unt S ally The first letter of each word helps you remember the order in which to compute operations in an equation: While 10/5 is equal to 2, you must remember the negative sign. Any number divided by zero is always undefined. The 4s cancel each other out, which means the answer is 3. When dividing fractions, remember to take the reciprocal of the divisor. In this case, the answer is 5. A review of common math concepts can help prevent simple calculation errors. The most problematic areas are fractions, the order of operations, and rounding with decimals. Fractions show parts of a whole. Decimals also show parts of a whole. Working from left to right from the decimal point, the place values are tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, and so on. The order of operations is a series of steps that must be performed in a certain order to ensure only one correct answer is available. Use the mnemonic device "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" to help you remember the correct order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and/or division, and addition and/or subtraction. Statistics are divided into two types: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive statistics describe the information in the data set. Inferential statistics provide data from a small group that is part of a larger group. The data are then used to draw conclusions or make inferences about the larger group. You are probably already familiar with some terms used in statistics, such as mean, median, and mode. There are two types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics . Descriptive statistics summarize or describe our data set. They give us information about the data, but they have no predictive or inferential power. Descriptive statistics simply provide a snapshot of what the data look like. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, have the power to make predictions.. With inferential statistics, we can use data collected from a sample to make inferences or conclusions about the larger unmeasured population . The inferential statistical tests that we use take into account that our sample may differ in some ways from the population. In other words, those chance factors that would make our sample different from the population (i.e., the luck of the draw) are taken into account by the inferential statistical tests that we use. So what do we mean by population or sample? The population refers to the group or collection of all possible members or outcomes that are of interest to the researcher. The population could be all college students in the United States, all college students at XYZ University, or all students registered in a statistics course online across the state of Georgia. Population, in statistical terms, DOES NOT mean all people living in a state, a country, or the world. It simply refers to all members of the group that the researcher is interested in studying. Often, researchers cannot have access to the population of interest. In those cases, a sample is chosen from the population. There are many ways a sample can be selected from the population – that's a class in and of itself! But a sample refers to some subset of the population of interest, and should use randomization as much as possible to ensure the representativeness of the sample to the population. Researchers use the sample to collect and analyze data,and then use the results to make inferences about the population. In other words, researchers are interested in studying populations, but since they can't usually access the entire population, they study a sample and use the sample results to draw conclusions about the population. For example, if a population consists of 5,000 people, researchers may take a sample of 500 from the entire population and draw a conclusion about the population based on sample results on certain tests. In this way, the researchers make inferences about the whole population (provided the sample was randomly selected and of an adequate size), based upon the results from the sample. In statistics, when we are working with whole populations, we refer to the values that we use to describe the data as parameters . When working with a sample, which is far more often the case, we refer to those values as statistics Population: use parameter and Sample: use statistic There are many statistical terms that can be considered a parameter or a statistic, including mean, standard deviation, median, mode, and a host of others. If we are talking about a population mean, then we would refer to that mean as a parameter. If we are talking about a sample mean, then that mean would be considered a statistic. Similarly, with the standard deviation; if it is a population standard deviation, it is considered a parameter. If it is a sample standard deviation, it is a statistic. Data are gathered from one of two sources: the population or a sample of the population. In statistics, the population is the entire group in which the researcher is interested and refers to all members of that group. Sometimes, collecting data on the entire population is not practical or possible. In these cases, a sample of the population is used. The more randomly chosen a sample is, the better it represents the population. Parameters describe the data of a population. Statistics describe the data of a sample . For example, the median of a population is a parameter, but the median of a sample is a statistic. Variables can vary or take on different values. They can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative variables represent quantities using numbers, such as the age or number of children. Qualitative variables represent qualities such as gender or blood type. Think of the data on a driver's license: your height and weight are quantitative values, and your eye color and gender are qualitative values. A variable is something that can take on more than one value or form, something that can vary. An example of a variable might be test scores (students can have a wide range of scores on a test), task time (participants in a research study would finish a task at different times), the amount of a medication given to participants (5mg or 10mg), or the way in which a student takes a statistics course (online, face-to-face, or hybrid). The list of possible variables is endless! Variables can be quantitative or categorical (also referred to as qualitative). Quantitative variables have a numeric value: variables measured in time, pounds, inches, or test scores. Quantitative variables are necessary for inferential statistical tests. Quantitative variables can be discrete (where there are gaps between the values that the variable can take) or continuous (on a scale where all numbers and points in between are possible values for the variable). Examples of discrete quantitative variables include number of people (since we can only have whole people!), IQ scores, and most standardized exams. Examples of continuous quantitative variables include time to complete a task, height, or weight. Categorical variables are not numeric in nature. They vary in "kind" not in amount. Examples of qualitative variables include gender, political affiliation, ethnicity, or favorite color. Categorical variables cannot be used with most descriptive and inferential statistical tests. There are, however, some non-parametric tests that we will discuss later in this course that allow us to perform statistical tests with categorical data. In addition to variables being quantitative or qualitative, they can be further broken down to the measurement scale used for data collection. There are four levels of measurement that we will discuss in this course, presented here in order of complexity starting with the most basic. Nominal Scale : The nominal scale of measurement is the most basic. Variables at this measurement level simply categorize our data into different groups. For example, demographic data on questionnaires is often categorical data collected at the nominal level: gender, religious affiliation, employment status, or type of car that one drives. There's not much we can do statistically with nominal data. All we can do is count how many are in each category. In order to conduct any analyses with nominal data, we must use non-parametric statistics. Ordinal Scale : The ordinal scale of measurement comes next in terms of complexity. Variables at this basic scale of measurement are also categorical but order is implied. In other words, the first category presented is lower than the second category, which is lower than the third category and so on. Examples include: Variables on the ordinal scale do imply order – we know that one item ranks higher than another item – but we still can't use the descriptive or inferential tests that we will learn about in this course. In order to analyze data collected on the ordinal scale, we will need to use non-parametric statistical tests. Survey Response Scales : strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree Order : A list of racers in the order they finished or a list of students in order of their overall grade point average Rank Order : Rank your top three choices, with 1 being the item you most want. Interval Scale : The interval scale improves upon the ordinal scale by forcing a set interval between points on the scale. In other words, the distance between options one and two are the same as the distance between options two and three and so on. Variables on the interval scale are quantitative and can be added together and subtracted from one another, but they cannot be multiplied or divided (that is, they cannot assume ratio statements). In addition, interval scale variables have an arbitrary zero point, meaning that a score of zero has meaning and does not mean the absence of that variable. Examples of interval variables include temperature and IQ. With temperature, zero degrees (Celsius and Fahrenheit scales) is a legitimate temperature; it does not mean the absence of temperature. Likewise, we can say that 30 degrees Celsius is 15 degrees warmer than 15 degrees Celsius, but we cannot say that 30 degrees Celsius is twice as warm as 15 degrees Celsius. Ratio Scale : The ratio scale of measurement assumes all characteristics of the previous three scales, but allows for a true zero point and ratio statements. Ratio scales are quantitative in nature, and a score of zero means the complete absence of the variable being measured. Examples of ratio variables include height, weight, and money. Ratio statements can be made with variables measured on this scale: we can say that two pounds is twice as heavy as one pound; $1 is twice as much money as $0.50; or 12 inches is twice as long as 6 inches. Interval and ratio scales allow us to use inferential statistical tests, which gives us the power to make inferences about the population from our sample. You have just a few more variable terms to learn. Here, we explore independent and dependent variables. Inferential statistics are used for experimental research. Experimental research is the best type of research design for testing cause-and-effect relationships between variables. In experimental research, the investigator attempts to influence an independent variable in order to see its effect on the dependent variable . In other words, the independent variable is what the researcher studies to see how it affects the dependent variable. Researchers often have to deal with extraneous variables in experimental research. These extraneous variables are unexpected events or characteristics that may have an effect on the dependent variable, thus affecting the overall results. Researchers cannot predict or control extraneous variables; in fact, researchers may never even know about some of them. Examples of extraneous variables are limitless! A few that might play into a study investigating GRE preparation techniques include test anxiety; loud, disruptive noises during testing that only affects one of the groups; individual examinee differences and issues; or differences in testing situations, including room temperature or set up, test administrators, or examinee issues that affect the entire room. Variables can be quantitative or qualitative. The difference is quantitative variables have a numeric value and can be discrete or continuous while qualitative variables are not numeric and are grouped according to category. Statistics also includes different scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Interval and ratio scales are used with inferential statistical tests from which you can make inferences about a population based on what you learned from the sample. Experimental research tests the cause-and-effect relationships between variables. A researcher tries to influence an independent variable in order to see its effect on the dependent variable. A researcher might test how the amount of calories consumed affects the amount of weight gained or lost. Extraneous variables are unexpected events that researchers cannot predict or control. These may affect the dependent variable and the overall results. Once information is collected about a certain population, the data are organized and analyzed. The resulting statistics summarize the data and can help you make informed decisions, whether about which profession to enter based on potential job opportunities or about which mechanic to go to based on customer satisfaction. Descriptive statistics describe the information in the data set. Once collected, data need to be organized so that they can be analyzed. You can organize data by creating a table that shows how spread out or how similar the data are, or you may want to represent the data visually by using a graph. Data need to be organized to be analyzed. Only then can informed statements be made about the population or sample population being studied Data are often presented visually using graphs so that the information is accessible and more easily interpreted. Frequency distributions are one way to organize data collected from research. Frequency distributions help display how spread out or how similar data are and make it easy to identify any extreme values, or outliers . Data can be sorted using regularly spaced intervals, or class intervals . Depending on the data, you might choose intervals of 0 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30, and so on. You would choose the range of the intervals based on the data you collected. Class intervals are helpful when you have a large quantity of values to analyze. Frequency distributions are a way of organizing raw data, that is, the data that we collect during a research project, to make it easier to get a snapshot of what we have. They also make it easier to see how spread out or how similar our data are. In addition, outliers (extreme scores) are easily seen in a frequency distribution. A frequency distribution is a collection of observations (or data) presented in an organized manner by listing the frequency of each observation's occurrence. Observations can be sorted into class intervals or remain ungrouped. Regardless of how the data are grouped, the frequency of the data is reported for each value or class interval. Class intervals are often used in frequency distributions, especially when the number of observations is large or there are lots of individual observations. Class intervals must be the same size, must be consecutive, and must include all individual observations (or data). Likewise, each observation can only be included in one class interval. The numbers listed here represent our observations or raw data that were collected during our study. Presented as they are, we cannot tell anything about our data. We can't easily identify our highest and lowest values, or see how many of each value we have. Steps to creating a frequency distribution: A frequency distribution table showing the frequency at different class intervals. The intervals and frequencies are as follows. 90-99: 2 100-109: 7 110-119: 17 120-129: 12 130-139: 7 140-149: 3 150-159: 4 160-169: 2 170-179: 0 180-189: 3 190-199: 0 200-209: 1 Here is an example of the Frequency Distribution from our earlier data set The first two columns are exactly what we had earlier: our class intervals and the frequency of observations for each class. The third column represents relative frequency which is the frequency of each class divided by the total number of observations. It is the proportion of observations that fall within each class and is always a decimal less than 1. Cumulative frequency and cumulative relative frequency show us at a glance how many or what proportion of our observations falls at or below a certain class interval. Both columns start at the lowest class and work up to the largest class, each class accumulating the observations from all classes before. Cumulative frequency is a count of how many observations fall at or below a given class, and the final entry should be the total number of observations overall. Cumulative relative frequency is the proportion of observations that fall at or below a given class, and the final entry should sum to 1.000. A frequency distribution table with five columns; first column with class intervals, second column with frequency, third column with relative frequency, fourth column with cumulative frequency, and fifth column with cumulative relative frequency. Interval 90-99: Frequency 2, Relative Frequency 2/52 = .038, Cumulative Frequency 2, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .038 Interval 100-109: Frequency 1, Relative Frequency 1/52 = .019, Cumulative Frequency 2+1=3, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .038+.019=.057 Interval 110-119: Frequency 17, Relative Frequency 17/52 = .327, Cumulative Frequency 3+17=20, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .057+.327=.384 Interval 120-129: Frequency 12, Relative Frequency .231, Cumulative Frequency 20+12=32, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .384+.231=.615 Interval 130-139: Frequency 7, Relative Frequency .135, Cumulative Frequency 39, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .750 Interval 140-149: Frequency 3, Relative Frequency .058, Cumulative Frequency 42, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .808 Interval 150-159: Frequency 4, Relative Frequency .077, Cumulative Frequency 46, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .885 Interval 160-169: Frequency 2, Relative Frequency .038, Cumulative Frequency 48, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .923 Interval 170-179: Frequency 0, Relative Frequency 0, Cumulative Frequency 48, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .923 Interval 180-189: Frequency 3, Relative Frequency .058, Cumulative Frequency 51, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .981 Interval 190-199: Frequency 0, Relative Frequency 0, Cumulative Frequency 51, and Cumulative Relative Frequency .981 Interval 200-209: Frequency 1, Relative Frequency .019, Cumulative Frequency 52, and Cumulative Relative Frequency 1.000 Total Frequency 52, Relative Frequency 1.000, Cumulative Frequency 52, and Cumulative Relative Frequency 1.000. With a frequency distribution, you can quickly skim the data and compare the number of observations in each class interval. Follow these steps to create a frequency distribution: Relative frequency is the ratio of observations in each class interval to the total number of observations. This value is always a decimal less than 1. The type of graph used to visually present data depends on the data itself. You cannot use just any graph to represent any data. For example, if you want to show how the data change over time, you would use a line graph. If you want to show the percentage breakdown of the results, you would probably use a pie chart. Knowing what type of data each graph best displays will help you better analyze data, whether you are building a graph or interpreting a graph. Data can be organized and presented visually using graphs. There are several types of graphs that can be used to illustrate the data. Caution: only certain graphs can be used with certain types of data!! In other words, you can't just choose the graph you like the best to illustrate your data. You must choose a graph that can appropriately showcase the type of data with which you are dealing. Bar graphs are used with qualitative or categorical datal. A bar graph simply presents the count for each category, that is, the frequency of responses in each group. A bar graph depicting the percentage of Part-time instructors at each institution type for 2005 and 2010. 2 year Institutions: 20% in 2005 and just under 30% in 2010. 4 year Liberal Arts: about 17% in 2005 and 25% in 2010. 4 year Comprehensive: 20% in 2005 and about 28% in 2010. Research no Eng PhD: about 18% in 2005 and about 29% in 2010. Research Eng PhD: about 6% in 2005 and about 11% in 2010. A histogram looks like a bar graph but it isn't! True, it uses the same bar-like rectangles, but in this case, the x-axis is a continuous scale. For this reason, a histogram is used with quantitative data on the interval or the ratio scale. The y-axis still represents the frequency of observations at each x-axis value. A histogram depicting the distribution of weights of one week old Labrador puppies in a sample size of 150. The X-axis is Weight in kilograms and the Y-axis is Relative Frequency expressed as percent per .01kg. A scatter plot is used to graph matched or paired quantitative data. A value from variable one is matched to the corresponding value on variable two, and a point is plotted where the two values intersect on the graph. For example, if we tracked rats' weight at a particular age, we could plot each point on a graph. If a rat is 5 weeks old and weighs 1.8 grams, then we can plot the point at (5, 1.8). Scatter plots allow us to visually see relationships in our data (for example, do younger rats always have smaller weights?). A scatter plot depicting the weights of rats by age. The X-axis shows age from 0 to 20 in 5 year increments, and the Y-axis shows weight from 0 to 2.5 in .5 increments. The trend shows a steady drop in weight from age 0 to 10, then a spike up between 10 and 15, then a drop and another spike up between 15 and 20. The data points are as follows: Between ages 0 and 5, there are four data points starting at weight 2 and decreasing to weight 1.7. Between ages 5 and 10, there are two data points, one at weight 1.6 and one at weight 1. Between ages 10 and 15, there are two data points, one at weight 1.1 and the next at weight 1.5. Between ages 15 and 20, there are two data points, one at weight 1.2 and the next at weight 1.4. A line graph is similar to a scatter plot in that we use it to graph two quantitative, matched variables. The difference here is that a line connects each point, and implies that the data is continuous in nature. A line graph depicting the weights of rats by age. The X-axis shows age in uneven increments to correspond with each data point, and the Y-axis shows weight from 0 to 2.5 in .5 increments. The trend shows a steady decline from ages 0 to 6, a sharper decline at age 7, then a rise from 11-13, a drop between 14 and 18, and a modest rise at 19. The data points are as follows: (0,2), (1, 1.9), (3, 1.8), (4, 1.7), (6, 1.6), (7, 1), (11, 1.1), (13, 1.5), (14, 1.3), (19, 1.4). A stem and leaf plot gives a quick visual of our data. The stem goes to the left of the vertical line, and the leaves go to the right. For each observation in this distribution, the stem is the value in the tens place, and the leaf is the value in the ones place. We include the 20s even though we don't have any observations in that category. Once we complete the stem and leaf plot, we can quickly see which category has the largest frequency of observations: the 60s. In fact, the stem and leaf plot looks visually like a bar graph turned on its side. For example, if we had the data set of 16, 35, 37, 43, 44, 47, 48, 51, 51, 52, 52, 54, 55, 57, 60, 62, 62, 64, 64, 65, 66, 68, 68, 71, 76, 76, 77, 78, 83, 85, 87, 90, 96, our stem and leaf plot would look like this: A Stem and Leaf Plot for data set: 16, 35, 37, 43, 44, 47, 48, 51, 51, 52, 52, 54, 55, 57, 60, 62, 62, 64, 64, 65, 66, 68, 68, 71, 76, 76, 77, 78, 83, 85, 87, 90, 96. The Stem is divided by 10s. Pie charts are used to show a percentage or proportion of a whole. They are used with qualitative or categorical data and show simply the frequency of observations from each category. Pie charts can only be used when it is appropriate to show how many observations of all observations fall in to each category. A pie chart depicting the percentage of people in 2010 with specific professional identities. Different types of graphs are useful for showing various types of data. Some examples of graphs include bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots, line graphs, stem-and-leaf plots, and pie charts. Each of these graphs serves a specific function to visually display percentages, growth, distribution, relationships, and other key factors necessary in the analysis of data. Each graph is designed to showcase a certain kind of data. Raw data have no meaning until they are organized and analyzed. Data can be organized in tables to show the breakdown of information, or they can be represented visually using graphs. In order for data not to be distorted or misrepresented, interval and ratio scales must be consistent and regularly spaced. All data must be included on the graph. Knowing the type of graph to use to display different types of data will help you to better analyze and interpret the collected information.
